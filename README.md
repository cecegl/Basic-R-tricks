# Have you ever needed to do the most basic of tasks on R but spent hours looking for the way to do it?

#### *Don't worry, it happens to the best of us...*

#### BUT, Look no further!

Here I will compile **tiny code chunks** that helped me with rutinary stuff such as moving files from one folder to another, deleting stuff I don't want, etc

This will **always** be a *work in progress*, because in coding you never stop learning new tricks, but I thought it would be nice to have a public repository where you could go
and (*maybe*) find **just** the code you were looking for!

<sub>**NOTE:** In no way does this pretend to be an exhaustive repository, I will add more stuff whenever I need those tricks in my daily work (this will mostly
be a repository to allow for my short-term memory to take a break from basic code syntax)</sub>
